# Boosting Antimicrobial Peptide Recognition through Deep Learning

### Abstract
Antibiotic resistance is a serious worldwide health threat that underscores the need for new
therapeutic agents. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), that are part of the natural components of innate
immunity, have been recognized as promising drug candidate molecules. Although conventional
machine learning techniques have been used to predict AMP recognition, their performances are
bounded. Here, we extend current deep learning methods for AMP classification by utilizing
convolutional and recurrent neural network layers to model local sequence motifs as well as long-
range dependencies. To further improve predictive performance, we introduce the incorporation of an attention mechanism,
which allows the model to attend to the most informative areas of peptide
sequences. Empirical evidence shows that deep learning performs much better than traditional
models on broad benchmark datasets. In addition, through analysis of learned embeddings, we
locate a diminished amino acid alphabet of nine residue groups that provides competitive
performance. Models and datasets are made available on the web server of the Antimicrobial
Peptide Scanner v2, providing a useful resource for future research and drug discovery centered on
AMPs.
